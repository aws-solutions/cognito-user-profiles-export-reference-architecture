# Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture
This solution uses an [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) workflow (`ExportWorkflow`) to periodically export user profiles, groups, and group membership details from your user pool to an [Amazon DynamoDB global table](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/) with automatic, asynchronous replication to a backup Region for added resiliency. This solution is designed to provide a framework for exporting user profile and group information from your user pool, allowing you to focus on extending the solution’s functionality rather than managing the underlying infrastructure operation. 

This solution’s `ImportWorkflow` Step Functions workflow can be used to populate a new, empty user pool with data from the global table, allowing you to easily recover user profiles, groups, and group memberships. The `ImportWorkflow` Step Functions workflow can be run in either the primary or backup Region.

> **_NOTE:_**  Some data loss will result when running the `ImportWorkflow` Step Functions workflow because this solution runs periodically. For example, if you schedule exports daily, you will lose up to a day’s worth of user pool updates depending on when the `ImportWorkflow` Step Functions workflow was run.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture](architecture-diagram.png)

## Getting Started
### 1. Prerequsites
The following procedures assumes that all of the OS-level configuration has been completed. They are:
- [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Node.js 16.x

The Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture is developed with Node.js for the microservices that run in AWS Lambda. The latest version has been tested with Node.js 16.x.

### 2. Clone the Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture repository
Clone the ```cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture``` GitHub repositroy, then make the desired code changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture.git
```

### 3. Run unit tests
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests.
```bash
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

### 4. Declare environment variables
```bash
export REGION=aws-region-code # the AWS region to launch the solution (e.g. us-east-1)
export SECONDARY_REGION=aws-region-code # the AWS region that will serve as backup (e.g. eu-central-1)
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```

### 5. Create an Amazon S3 bucket
The AWS CloudFormation template is configured to pull the AWS Lambda deployment packages from Amazon S3 bucket in the region the template is being launched in. Create a bucket in the desitred region name appended to the name of the bucket. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION --region $REGION
aws s3 mb s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$SECONDARY_REGION --region $SECONDARY_REGION
```

### 6. Build the Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture for deployment
```bash
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

### 7. Upload deployment assets to your Amazon S3 bucket
* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```bash
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$SECONDARY_REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
```

### 8. Launch the Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture
- Get the link of cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture.template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
- Deploy the Cognito User Profiles Export Reference Architecture to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the S3 link of cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture.template.
